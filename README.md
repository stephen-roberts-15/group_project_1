Prevalance of Disorders vs Population

Over the last 10 years, is there a correlation between an increase in the Population size and an increase in the Prevalence of the disorder around the world ?

We analyzed mental health disorder prevalence and population across 196 countries for the 

period 2012-2017. We compared the Prevalence of these disorders against the population. 

Calculated the correlation between Population and Prevalence of depressive 

disorder and prepared a scatter plot.  We found  a positive correlation between population and 

prevalence of depressive disorders i.e, equal to 1.So it is prominent that the depression % will 

keep increasing over the period as the population keeps increasing exponentially and other 

factors affect the same.Found the top 10 and bottom 10 countries having the most/least 

prevalence of depressive order by taking the mean for each country from the data for the last 

5 years. Included the same inference in the bar chart as well.  Also analyzed the percentage

 of male vs female population impacted and see that in most countries this group of disorders

 is more common for women than for men.In 2017, an estimated 264 million people in 

 The world experienced depression. The share of the population with depression ranges 

mostly between 2% to 6% around the world today. The data shown in our dataset 

demonstrates that health disorders are common everywhere.Improving awareness, 
recognition,support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential

focus on global health.
