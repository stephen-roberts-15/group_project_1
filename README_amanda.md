Prevalence and Patterns of Mental Health Disorders 
Final Analysis



Using the most recent 5 years of prevalence percentage data, the mean of each disease per country was calculated and a new frame of top 50 countries for each disorder was created. From there the disorder correlation was calcualted and any “r” value  above 0.6 was deemed meaningful based on discipline ( social sciences ). Anxiety and bipolar disorder had positive correlation with an “r ” of 0.65 while anxiety and eating disorders had an “r” of 0.67. Between the disorders associated with anxiety, there was a positive correlation between eating disorders and bipolar disorder, “r” value 0.70. In conclusion, anxiety positivley coreelated with bipolar disorder and eating disorders, suggesting those who suffer from one might suffer from another as well. 

From the last 5 years of  orignal study data, the mean percentage per country of anxiety and depression were taken and normalized. These noramlized values were then compared to the historical average high temperatures pulled from  meteostat API. Plotted on a map, with plot size relating to temperature and opacity relating to disorder prevalence, we see some patterns. This showed hotter climates did not have higher anxiety percentages, but colder climates did have higher anxiety and depression percentages.
