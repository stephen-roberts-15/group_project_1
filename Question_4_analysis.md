Do countries with high anxiety rates also have high dpression rates? Does population have an impact to mental health disorders? Is there any relationship between income and rates of anxiety and depression? 


From the dataset, data from the most recent 5 years of the study was used for analysis (2013- 2017)

Plotting anxiety rate against depression rate for all countries and years with availabe data yielded a mild correlation with an r-squared value of 0.35

Comparing the rates of depression between the 5 largest countries by population and the 5 smallest countries, there was no corrleation in the rates of depressive disorders. 


Using the Worldbank API, data was gathered for GNI (Gross National Income) per capita for the year 2017 for each country. There did not appear to be any correlation between GNI per capita and depression rate with an r squared value of 0.13, however there was a positive correlation between GNI per capita and anxiety with an r squared value of 0.54
